Web Development

Web Development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It includes everything from designing how a website looks to making sure it works properly behind the scenes.

Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. Frontend (Client-side)

This is the part of the website users see and interact with.
It includes layout, colors, images, buttons, and text.
Common technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

2. Backend (Server-side)

This is the behind-the-scenes part that users don’t see.
It handles data, authentication, server logic, and connections to databases.
Technologies may include: Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, Ruby.

3. Database

Stores and manages data for the website or app.
Examples: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
-------------------------------------

Frontend (Client-Side)

The frontend is everything the user sees and interacts with on the website. It includes the layout, colors, buttons, text, images, animations, and overall design.
Responsibilities:

Display content and user interface (UI).

Handle user interactions like clicks, forms, and navigation.

Communicate with the backend to send or receive data.

Ensure the website looks good on different devices (responsive design).

Provide a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue…


Backend (Server-Side)

The backend is the hidden part that runs on the server. It processes requests from the frontend and handles the core logic of the application.
Responsibilities:

Receive requests from the frontend and respond with the correct data.

Handle business logic (rules and processes).

Manage user authentication (login, signup).

Connect to the database and retrieve or store information.

Ensure security, performance, and reliability.

Technologies: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), PHP, Java, Ruby…


Database

The database stores all the information the web application uses. It keeps the data organized, secure, and accessible when needed.
Responsibilities:

Store data such as users, products, orders, posts, etc.

Allow the backend to add, update, delete, or read data.

Ensure data consistency and integrity.

Handle large amounts of data efficiently.

Keep data safe with backups and security measures.

Types of Databases:

SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

NoSQL: MongoDB, Firebase, Redis
