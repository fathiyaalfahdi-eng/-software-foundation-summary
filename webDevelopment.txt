Web Development

Web Development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It includes everything from designing how a website looks to making sure it works properly behind the scenes.

Here’s a simple breakdown:

1. Frontend (Client-side)

This is the part of the website users see and interact with.
It includes layout, colors, images, buttons, and text.
Common technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

2. Backend (Server-side)

This is the behind-the-scenes part that users don’t see.
It handles data, authentication, server logic, and connections to databases.
Technologies may include: Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, Ruby.

3. Database

Stores and manages data for the website or app.
Examples: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
